# diary
```
As a user
So that I can keep a daily diary
I want to be able to add a new entry to my diary.

As a user
So that I can identify my entry in future
I want to give each entry a date and body

As a user
So that I can browse my previous entries
I want to see a list of all entries.

As a user
So that I can read my previous entries on a day
I want to find all the entries for a particular date.

As a user,
So I know what was my busiest day,
I can find out which date had the most entries.
